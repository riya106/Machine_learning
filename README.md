# Linear Regression – Learning Progress

This folder contains my **learning progress for Linear Regression** in Machine Learning.  
I am currently exploring concepts step by step and experimenting with code while learning.

This is **not a final or polished project**, but a part of my continuous ML learning journey.

## 📊 Datasets Used

- **homeprice.csv**  
  Used to understand linear regression with a categorical feature (`town`)  
  → Practiced **one-hot encoding**

- **price.csv**  
  Used for basic linear regression practice

- **salary.csv**  
  Used to understand relationship between experience and salary

##  What I’m Learning Here

- Basics of **Linear Regression**
- How to read CSV files using Pandas
- How to handle categorical data using `pd.get_dummies()`
- How to train a model using `LinearRegression`
- How to save models using:
  - `joblib`
  - `pickle`

I am still experimenting and improving my understanding.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

##  Current Status

- Learning in progress  
- Code may change frequently  
- Folder structure may be updated as I learn more  

This repository reflects **practice + experimentation**, not production-ready ML.

##  Goal

To build a strong foundation in Machine Learning concepts and gradually move towards:
- Better structured projects
- Clean implementations
- Real-world use cases
